## Pre-commit Hook

This project uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to manage Git hooks. When you commit a change, Husky runs the following commands automatically:

```
npm run format:fix && npm run lint && npm test
```

- `npm run format:fix`: This command formats your code using a formatter (e.g., Prettier).
- `npm run lint`: This command runs the linter to check for code quality issues.
- `npm test`: This command runs the test suite to ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality.

These commands help maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
